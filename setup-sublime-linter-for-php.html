	<p>SublimeLinter is a great tool for SublimeText2, however, it took a bit of research.</p>

<p>Installing is easy, go here:Â <a href="https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter#installing">https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter#installing</a></p>

<p>Setting up for PHP development is the harder part.</p>

<p>After a bunch of research I figured it out</p>

<p>I have both wamp and xampp installed on my machine, but I used xampp for this example as that&#8217;s the php path I found first.</p>

<p>In SublimeLinter -&gt; Settings - User add the following (yes you need to \s)
<code>
{
    "sublimelinter<em>executable</em>map":
    {
        "php": "C:&#92;xampp&#92;php&#92;php.exe"
    }
}
</code></p>

<p>And save. I found I had to reload ST2 to get it to work properly.</p>

<p>After you reload, open up a php file and rename the scope of a function or something, as you type it you will see the entire line (or sometimes the line below) get highlighted. This means it&#8217;s working.</p>

<p>If you didn&#8217;t see any line highlights, open up the the command line (ctrl/cmd+~) and you will see that PHP hadn&#8217;t loaded properly into ST2. Fix up the path to your php.exe in the SublimeLinter User Settings and then you will be good to go.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Sublime Linter no longer highlights syntax every milisecond, it now waits for you to stop typing a bit or save.</p>
