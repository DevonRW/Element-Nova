	<p>I finally made it to a BarCamp. In fact, I actually spoke at it. More on that in a bit.</p>

<h2>What I learned from the talks</h2>

<ol>
<li>Coding live with people looks kinda stressful if something silly isn&#8217;t working</li>
<li>Everyone&#8217;s on your side</li>
</ol>

<h2>What I learned from my talk</h2>

<ol>
<li>Have your presentation on your machine, since having internet access isn&#8217;t gonna happen</li>
<li>Practicing a few times before hand sure helps when your notes aren&#8217;t working for some dumb reason</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all this was a good experience. I wasn&#8217;t too happy with my presentation but I was happy that I did it.</p>

<p>The talk I gave was mostly high level ideas about how we should build our websites for everyone by targeting HTML4 and then HTML5 browsers, as well as performance improving ideas. I&#8217;ll be discussing these ideas in more details with the majority of the zu devs in the morning.</p>

<p>Good catching up with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dmosher">@dmosher</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fexd">@fexd</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/thebatlab">@thebatlab</a> and finally meeting <a href="http://www.twitter.com/interlock">@interlock</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gingerk">@gingerk</a> in person.</p>
