	</div>

	<p>We used to think that recaptcha was great. All we had to do was drop a small script into our server side driven site, and BOOM no more spam.</p>

<p>We were not paying attention to what we actually did, however. We made it annoying for our users. Every single one of our users then had to squint at a screen and enter two barely readable (and more and more recently it became completely unreadable) words.</p>

<p>We took our problem and made it our users&#8217; problem. That is terrible. We&#8217;re engineers and scientists and other fancy words/phrases that make use sound super smart. We solve the problem, not pass the buck.</p>

<p>Now there is an unusable element on all of our forms that needs to be removed.</p>

<p>We found a, better, alternative.
<blockquote>Stop the spam on the server.</blockquote>
We rolled a couple of our own solutions in one of our client&#8217;s sites. I&#8217;m not sure of the correct naming of the second technique we used but the first one used is called &#8220;Honey Pot&#8221; and the second one is called &#8220;timestamp token&#8230;.thingy technique&#8221; (see, no idea on the name)</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t put the code we used here, but I&#8217;ll tell you HOW it works.</p>

<h2>Honey Pot</h2>

<p>Most bots will fill out every single field on a form for submitting. Some bots only fill out basic fields like name, email, address. So, we&#8217;re going to catch poor old Pooh-bear with his hand in the honey jar.</p>

<p>Add an additional input (type text) field with a name of &#8220;name&#8221; (you could also use &#8220;address&#8221;) to the start of your form.</p>

<p>On submission, if the field has ANYTHING entered into it, the form will not submit. We set it up to just appear like everything is fine but the form didn&#8217;t pass validation, even though it appears that everything is fine.</p>

<p>Now, there is a form with an input field that you cannot put anything into. That isn&#8217;t very user friendly.</p>

<p>We added 3 more things to clear this up.</p>

<ol>
<li>We added a comment of &#8220;do not fill out this field&#8221; into the same element that was typically used for displaying the &#8220;required&#8221; field red *.</li>
<li>We added a style to the label of the honey pot field that made it hidden. Do that in your stylesheet, not inline.</li>
<li>We removed the label and input field from the DOM using Javascript.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, there is only one possible way for someone to see that field now. Their web browser must not be able to handle basic css and cannot handle basic Javascript. Any other situation and it will not display.</p>

<p>Our users do not see the field, the high high high majority of web bots do not understand javascript so they element remains in the DOM for them to stick their dirty little fingers into. And after they fill out that field and submit to spam away, nothing happens. The form comes back and it appears that everything is okay but the submission just did not work.</p>

<p>I admit, I was a little bit concerned that a bot would get stuck in an infinite loop on our site, but I figured one connection constantly loading a page for now until who knows when would be acceptable since it takes more than one form being submitted every 20 seconds to do a DDOS attack.</p>

<h2>Timestamp Token &#8230; Thingy Technique</h2>

<p>Another thing we learned while researching how bots work is that they submit forms almost instantly.</p>

<p>So, if you completely fill out a form and it&#8217;s submitted in &lt;= 3 seconds. No worky.</p>

<p>Nothing was required for the front end of the site for this except a timestamp in a random hidden field. We also encrypted the timestamp and the name of the field is something that looks like it&#8217;s required for some bizarre CMS.</p>

<p>On the server the field is unencrypted, checked that it&#8217;s a valid timestamp and that it&#8217;s from more than 4 seconds ago. If it isn&#8217;t, the form appears that there is a problem and will not submit, just like the honey pot, but there isn&#8217;t anything obvious about what is wrong.</p>

<p>Every now and then I was able to trigger this as a human by submitting the field and having a field be wrong (email address not formatted properly, or something of the like). If I VERY quickly fixed the error that I had created and submitted the form I could get the timestamp to be submitted too quickly. But this was on one of about nine or ten tries.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not concerned about something like that as only people who are very familiar with these particular contact forms would be able to trigger this error. Also, if you submit a form and it says everything is fine but it doesn&#8217;t submit, you end up spending a few seconds going over the form with a fine-tooth comb and realizing it should work, and click submit again in which it now works.</p>

<p>I had to sell myself a little bit on this that it wouldn&#8217;t be a burden to our client&#8217;s clients. However, the chances of someone running into this situation is a little bit less rare than a non-CSS/non-JS web browser coming by and using the form (in my opinion).</p>

<h2>The fruits of our labour</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ve had the forms now live on our client&#8217;s site for almost 2 weeks now, and guess what, 0 spam. We&#8217;ve seen about a 50% increase in form submissions (I&#8217;m guessing at that number, I do see a higher amount of submissions come through than before) and no spam.</p>

<p>To do this as opposed to integrating recaptcha into our site would have been the smart move back in 2008, since, based on the code we saw, it looks like it took about the same amount of time to put in these 2 techniques as it would have taken to integrate recaptcha into this home-grown CMS.</p>

	<h1><a href="./the-smart-fridge-that-id-actually-buy.html">The Smart Fridge that I&#039;d actually buy</a></h1>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<span class="post-date">September 8, 2012&nbsp;16:54:10</span>
	</div>

	<p>I was standing at my fridge last night looking at the gigantic calendar that we have on it and I thought &#8220;we need more information available here&#8221;. My eldest daughter does 7 things throughout the week. Every single one of those events is on the calendar. We get garbage pickup every week (soon to be every other week). We get recycle picked up every other week. We manage our finances every two weeks (we&#8217;re on a jar system). My wife does contract work outside of the house so that&#8217;s tracked. Our meal plan is on the calendar as well. Everything I just mentioned is on this calendar. It isn&#8217;t sustainable.</p>

<p>My 2nd child will be starting her own activities soon, be it swimming or soccer or whatever, and where will THAT go? I&#8217;ve been playing around with Google Calendar and ToDo lists and the like and nothing is as nicely usable and shareable and in your face as a calendar on the fridge.</p>

<p>I began thinking that the fridge needs touchscreen calendar on it. Any typical calendar software would do, I just need to put WAY more information ,that&#8217;s nicely laid out, on my fridge than I have space for.</p>

<p>I figured &#8220;someone has to have an android fridge out by now&#8221; and did some googling. Turns out the only smart fridges out there (that my very short googling found before Terra came out of her bedroom and threw a fit on the floor) have a really small touch screen interface with apps that don&#8217;t update.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well that&#8217;s stupid&#8221;, I thought. I then tweeted that I wanted an android fridge with a mega sized touchscreen that&#8217;s update-able for 30 years. Fridges need to last a long time. You don&#8217;t replace your fridge as often as you update the apps on your smart phone.</p>

<p>A response to my tweet said &#8220;So, you want a fridge with 16GB of RAM, and a multi-core processor?&#8221; and then I thought. 30 years from now 16GB of ram will feel like nothing, just like how 1GB of RAM feels like nothing now, whereas as a few years ago it was blazing fast.</p>

<p>The actual hardware needs to be easily replaceable.</p>

<p>Or.</p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t any hardware for the OS included. What if only the touch screen was provided. What IF you could plug in your device to the screen and it&#8217;s another iOS/android/tizen/whatever device. What if the fridge was just another screen for your device? Don&#8217;t want to deal with plugging and unplugging devices from your fridge all the time? Just buy a cheap android tablet and leave it hooked up. What if it functioned similar to google tv, apple tv? What if you just enhanced your fridge from it&#8217;s base settings with an external device.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re onto something.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t think of anyone I know who would want to spend $3500 every couple years to get a newer, up to date OS in their kitchen for their fridge. Same with the problem with smart tvs right now. We all bought our HD Tvs in the past 10 years and they still work fine. Why would I spend another few thousand dollars for something that barely enhances the fridge I currently have. A fridge only needs to keep my food cold. A great extension to the fridge would be organizing my family&#8217;s life.</p>

	<div class="post-meta">
		<span class="post-date">August 18, 2012&nbsp;15:20:14</span>
	</div>

	<p>SublimeLinter is a great tool for SublimeText2, however, it took a bit of research.</p>

<p>Installing is easy, go here: <a href="https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter#installing">https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter#installing</a></p>

<p>Setting up for PHP development is the harder part.</p>

<p>After a bunch of research I figured it out</p>

<p>I have both wamp and xampp installed on my machine, but I used xampp for this example as that&#8217;s the php path I found first.</p>

<p>In SublimeLinter -&gt; Settings - User add the following (yes you need to \s)
<code>
{
    "sublimelinter<em>executable</em>map":
    {
        "php": "C:&#92;xampp&#92;php&#92;php.exe"
    }
}
</code></p>

<p>And save. I found I had to reload ST2 to get it to work properly.</p>

<p>After you reload, open up a php file and rename the scope of a function or something, as you type it you will see the entire line (or sometimes the line below) get highlighted. This means it&#8217;s working.</p>

<p>If you didn&#8217;t see any line highlights, open up the the command line (ctrl/cmd+~) and you will see that PHP hadn&#8217;t loaded properly into ST2. Fix up the path to your php.exe in the SublimeLinter User Settings and then you will be good to go.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Sublime Linter no longer highlights syntax every milisecond, it now waits for you to stop typing a bit or save.</p>

	<div class="post-meta">

	</div>

	<p>I&#8217;ve been sitting here for 2 hours waiting for this WoW patch to apply and it allowed me to actually focus on learning a bit. No no not the PHP5 certification studying that I&#8217;ve been putting off for about 8 months, but actual fun learning.</p>

<p>Jason Grigsby (@grigs) <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/grigs/status/164554171062829057" target="_blank">reminded me</a> of an article of his that I read awhile ago. This article brings up some ideas about Mobile Phones being a new form of media that has it&#8217;s own unique capabilities. I think this was one of the first articles I read about Mobile Context.  I remember first reading this (or somehow finding my way there anyways) right after <a href="http://futurefriend.ly/" target="_blank">Future Friendly</a> launched. I do like that the majority of the Future Friendly &#8220;gang&#8221; are rather active on Twitter and also have blogs posts, it really feels like they&#8217;re taking a lead with this.</p>

<p>I keep finding that what I like about twitter is that if someone says something interesting you can talk to them. It&#8217;s like being in a room filled with millions of people, but with a massive filter on, that you can lift if you choose.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was thinking the other day &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be great if a website just &#8216;knew&#8217; what you wanted out of it based on what you were up to?&#8221;  Google recently changed so that they weren&#8217;t tracking you based on your demographic and whatever. A couple months ago, Google had a page that said what they thought I was interested in. It was 100% right. I thought that was awesome. They also changed the search results based on what I liked. I thought that was awesome. Get me the content I WANT quicker. Apparently I was the only one as privacy watchdogs (or somebody, I don&#8217;t actually know who, so I&#8217;m gonna point my unguided finger at them) didn&#8217;t like it and it had to be removed. I thought this was basically removing a huge piece of functionality from a great product. It knew what I wanted, so it gave it to me. Ya ya, we can argue &#8220;but google only wanted to increase revenue evil evil evil evil evil&#8221;. But&#8230;.it gave me what I wanted&#8230;.</p>

<p>Now, imagine if you would a website (let&#8217;s say a News website) that &#8220;knows&#8221; what you want to do while you&#8217;re there. It detects that you&#8217;re on a phone and haven&#8217;t moved too much in 1/2 an hour. It figures that you have a pretty good attention span because of this. It shows you one version of the site. With more information on topics and more info and related article links, etc.</p>

<p>K, next one, imagine that you are standing in line at the Grocery Store and read about a news topic on one of the newspapers (let&#8217;s say &#8220;Celebrity A has wed Celebrity B&#8221;&#8230;AND YOU DIDN&#8217;T KNOW ABOUT IT!&#8230;the horror). Your phone would know that you&#8217;ve been moving a lot, and then moving very little for 3 minutes, so less attention span, but should have enough for a couple minutes. Don&#8217;t bother displaying the related article links, since it knows you won&#8217;t have a chance to get to them. And since you don&#8217;t have time to read a long article, summarize that. A couple paragraphs with just the overall story. It would also know that you could be distracted at a moments notice so it offers a &#8220;read full article later&#8221; option.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure we could argue these couple things as one being desktop site and the other being mobile site, but I don&#8217;t want to click through stuff to get to there. I just want it to happen for me without me thinking about it.  Who am I, what am I up to.</p>

<p>What learning have I done? Lots. I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to get some Future Friendly ideas into our team&#8217;s major client. They&#8217;ve been receptive to Responsive Web Design, and I do feel that it&#8217;s the right way to go with their site. I&#8217;m also trying to get their content stored OUT of the site. All of their content is locked down in HTML in a database. We can kid ourselves and claim that that is able to be moved anywhere, but it&#8217;s in HTML. I&#8217;ve started playing around with a Content API in my spare time that would allow you to send in data in HTML and then it would strip it and change it to markdown. You could then call that data in a certain format for any device. Imagine grabbing something nicely formatted for an iOS app that&#8217;s the exact same content on their website (NPR gave me the idea). I really think that Markdown is the way to go. We can pretend that HTML is what we&#8217;ll be using on the web in 50 years, but we won&#8217;t know that until 50 years from now.</p>

<p>And no, I don&#8217;t have a summary thought.</p>
