	<p>After 4 hours of tossing and turning it was time for breakfast. Ralph tweeted me to come down for &#8220;Lean Coffee&#8221;. Having no idea what the heck he was talking about I said &#8220;hellz yea&#8221; and wandered down.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a typical conference-in-a-hotel meal. Bacon was good. Turns out that Lean Coffee is kinda neat. You start off with a bunch of ideas, then vote on what to discuss, whatever has the highest acceptance for discussion is what is discussed. I&#8217;m not sure if I actually learned anything at the breakfast (4 hours of sleep) but both Ralph and I came away from that thinking that we could do a Lean Lunch or something at zu to help with developer knowledge transfer.</p>

<p>Keynote speech. Things were kicked off with the creator of Gas Buddy, Jason Toews. He went through Gas Buddy&#8217;s rise and had a couple of good tips. One of those was to build things that people actually want. :p</p>

<p>Onto the conference proper!
<h2>Session 1: Testable Javascript</h2>
James Kovacs gave a brief overview of QUnit, Jasmine, and Mocha. Basically it was just &#8220;look, you can unit test JS, it&#8217;s really not that hard&#8221;. For what I currently do for front-end development I&#8217;m having a hard time trying to figure out how to fit this into our current process but I think after a discussion with a teammate or two that we&#8217;ll have something
<h2>Session 2: So, you want to be a Front-End Engineer?</h2>
Dave Mosher gave an incredible talk looking at how web browsers actually work. The overall idea was &#8220;how did we arrive at our best practices&#8221;. He went through what a browser does and the internal workings of it. After that he went through a few best practices and WHY we have them
<ol>
    <li>script tag right before your closing body tag</li>
    <li>nice selectors and how they work for CSS [no really&#8230;HOW they work, we spent what felt like quite a bit of time on it but it was sooooooooooo worth it]</li>
    <li>when using JS to modify things visually, assign class(es), not styles.</li>
</ol>
I really enjoyed this presentation. I&#8217;ve never seen Dave present before but this flowed quite nicely. Good jorb!
<h2>Lunch at 5 Guys or Everyone deciding not to go to 5 Guys</h2>
Yea, we all changed our minds at the last minute.</p>

<p>However, we had a nice table of 3 zu-peeps and 3 former zu-peeps for lunch so that was fun.
<h2>Session 4: Silence of Agile</h2>
This was led by Steve Rogalsky, who led the Lean Coffee thing at 7am, and was incredible. There only ended up being 6 or 7 people there, but I think that made it a lot better. The overall idea of the presentation was that talking can influence other&#8217;s decisions (or that&#8217;s what I got out of it). He promoted the idea of doing things in silence (estimating, organizing, and other things that I don&#8217;t remember right now).</p>

<p>He also had a few other ideas on the board that I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to bring to the team. I don&#8217;t think that Planning Poker would work well with us, but I do like the idea of Silent Planning Poker Party for big project estimations. I think Ralph was disagreeing with me on that one, but I don&#8217;t remember now (4 hours of sleep).</p>

<p>Steve also mentioned that at his company they do strategy planning with everyone in the company, and everyone has equal votes and equal ideas. So someone who is hired a week earlier has the same power as the CEO does. The CEO also goes towards the end of the planning so his decision does not affect what others do.</p>

<p>His presentation was very well done. Again, only having 6 or 7 people there made it more intimate. I think everyone else was at the HTML5 presentation learning that HTML5 exists or something.</p>

<p>At this point in time I started thinking &#8220;I could have probably done a presentation on Responsive Web Design&#8221; and then started putting together some notes. I&#8217;ll probably do a presentation at work on one and then see if BarCamp can fit into my homelife schedule (3rd kid coming soon).
<h2>Session 4: Continuous Integration Evolved</h2>
I barely remember what we talked about. Overall it was &#8220;CI is good, but are you actually doing true CI or do you just think you are?&#8221; Which did get me thinking a bit about how we currently do our releases on one of our ongoing projects.
<h2>Session 5: Do, This; No Do That: Building the Bridge Between Creative &amp; Code</h2>
This was presented by Eden Rhotensky and was enjoyable. Overall the idea was to improve relations between designers and developers. Now, I&#8217;m very lucky to work with a designer on our team, and I know that we bring out the best in each other, so I didn&#8217;t gain any grand schemes.</p>

<p>I do like the way she thinks about how to get things done and work as a team.
<h2>Supper all the things</h2>
Ralph, Andrew and I had supper together. Ralph and I have never really just sat and chatted about &#8220;stuffs&#8221; over a meal and a drink.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m up in my hotel room watching Raw and typing this.</p>

<p>Yup, good day. Super glad I came down here. Snaps to zu for footing the bill.</p>

	<p>I was trying to get a short video to help out Brian Hogan for a class he&#8217;s doing. The goal: &#8220;I want to get them fired up about our industry&#8221;.</p>

<p>I was super pumped at the idea and I spent a few minutes last night jotting down notes about what I wanted to say.</p>

<p>And then for some reason I couldn&#8217;t figure out the microphone on the laptop I&#8217;m currently using. Pain in the rear.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&#8217;s roughly what I wanted to say.
<blockquote>Introduce Self: Devon, web developer from zu</p>

<p>Why you love what you do:
Constant learning, new tools created by the community for the community, create and play with new techonolgies, solving new problems both big and small every day, support from others in the community, and being able to create something that is used and loved by countless people.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m lucky enough to be in an industry that has driven change in the world, be it from organizations using Google Maps to fight enormous amounts of deforestation, governments being able to share information quickly and easily with their citizens on github, or connecting with Star Trek cast member by him sending me a funny picture a teen vampire franchise</p>

<p>Web development, love it, I strongly recommend you start</blockquote></p>

<p>For fun you can see when I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mlovaswb7g" target="_blank">first attempted to record onto youtube.</a> (keep in mind, no audio&#8230;.)</p>

	<div class="post-meta">
		<span class="post-date">September 10, 2012&nbsp;03:16:33</span>
	</div>

	<p>We used to think that recaptcha was great. All we had to do was drop a small script into our server side driven site, and BOOM no more spam.</p>

<p>We were not paying attention to what we actually did, however. We made it annoying for our users. Every single one of our users then had to squint at a screen and enter two barely readable (and more and more recently it became completely unreadable) words.</p>

<p>We took our problem and made it our users&#8217; problem. That is terrible. We&#8217;re engineers and scientists and other fancy words/phrases that make use sound super smart. We solve the problem, not pass the buck.</p>

<p>Now there is an unusable element on all of our forms that needs to be removed.</p>

<p>We found a, better, alternative.
<blockquote>Stop the spam on the server.</blockquote>
We rolled a couple of our own solutions in one of our client&#8217;s sites. I&#8217;m not sure of the correct naming of the second technique we used but the first one used is called &#8220;Honey Pot&#8221; and the second one is called &#8220;timestamp token&#8230;.thingy technique&#8221; (see, no idea on the name)</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t put the code we used here, but I&#8217;ll tell you HOW it works.</p>

<h2>Honey Pot</h2>

<p>Most bots will fill out every single field on a form for submitting. Some bots only fill out basic fields like name, email, address. So, we&#8217;re going to catch poor old Pooh-bear with his hand in the honey jar.</p>

<p>Add an additional input (type text) field with a name of &#8220;name&#8221; (you could also use &#8220;address&#8221;) to the start of your form.</p>

<p>On submission, if the field has ANYTHING entered into it, the form will not submit. We set it up to just appear like everything is fine but the form didn&#8217;t pass validation, even though it appears that everything is fine.</p>

<p>Now, there is a form with an input field that you cannot put anything into. That isn&#8217;t very user friendly.</p>

<p>We added 3 more things to clear this up.</p>

<ol>
<li>We added a comment of &#8220;do not fill out this field&#8221; into the same element that was typically used for displaying the &#8220;required&#8221; field red *.</li>
<li>We added a style to the label of the honey pot field that made it hidden. Do that in your stylesheet, not inline.</li>
<li>We removed the label and input field from the DOM using Javascript.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, there is only one possible way for someone to see that field now. Their web browser must not be able to handle basic css and cannot handle basic Javascript. Any other situation and it will not display.</p>

<p>Our users do not see the field, the high high high majority of web bots do not understand javascript so they element remains in the DOM for them to stick their dirty little fingers into. And after they fill out that field and submit to spam away, nothing happens. The form comes back and it appears that everything is okay but the submission just did not work.</p>

<p>I admit, I was a little bit concerned that a bot would get stuck in an infinite loop on our site, but I figured one connection constantly loading a page for now until who knows when would be acceptable since it takes more than one form being submitted every 20 seconds to do a DDOS attack.</p>

<h2>Timestamp Token &#8230; Thingy Technique</h2>

<p>Another thing we learned while researching how bots work is that they submit forms almost instantly.</p>

<p>So, if you completely fill out a form and it&#8217;s submitted in &lt;= 3 seconds. No worky.</p>

<p>Nothing was required for the front end of the site for this except a timestamp in a random hidden field. We also encrypted the timestamp and the name of the field is something that looks like it&#8217;s required for some bizarre CMS.</p>

<p>On the server the field is unencrypted, checked that it&#8217;s a valid timestamp and that it&#8217;s from more than 4 seconds ago. If it isn&#8217;t, the form appears that there is a problem and will not submit, just like the honey pot, but there isn&#8217;t anything obvious about what is wrong.</p>

<p>Every now and then I was able to trigger this as a human by submitting the field and having a field be wrong (email address not formatted properly, or something of the like). If I VERY quickly fixed the error that I had created and submitted the form I could get the timestamp to be submitted too quickly. But this was on one of about nine or ten tries.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not concerned about something like that as only people who are very familiar with these particular contact forms would be able to trigger this error. Also, if you submit a form and it says everything is fine but it doesn&#8217;t submit, you end up spending a few seconds going over the form with a fine-tooth comb and realizing it should work, and click submit again in which it now works.</p>

<p>I had to sell myself a little bit on this that it wouldn&#8217;t be a burden to our client&#8217;s clients. However, the chances of someone running into this situation is a little bit less rare than a non-CSS/non-JS web browser coming by and using the form (in my opinion).</p>

<h2>The fruits of our labour</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ve had the forms now live on our client&#8217;s site for almost 2 weeks now, and guess what, 0 spam. We&#8217;ve seen about a 50% increase in form submissions (I&#8217;m guessing at that number, I do see a higher amount of submissions come through than before) and no spam.</p>

<p>To do this as opposed to integrating recaptcha into our site would have been the smart move back in 2008, since, based on the code we saw, it looks like it took about the same amount of time to put in these 2 techniques as it would have taken to integrate recaptcha into this home-grown CMS.</p>

	<h1><a href="./the-smart-fridge-that-id-actually-buy.html">The Smart Fridge that I&#039;d actually buy</a></h1>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<span class="post-date">September 8, 2012&nbsp;16:54:10</span>
	</div>

	<p>I was standing at my fridge last night looking at the gigantic calendar that we have on it and I thought &#8220;we need more information available here&#8221;. My eldest daughter does 7 things throughout the week. Every single one of those events is on the calendar. We get garbage pickup every week (soon to be every other week). We get recycle picked up every other week. We manage our finances every two weeks (we&#8217;re on a jar system). My wife does contract work outside of the house so that&#8217;s tracked. Our meal plan is on the calendar as well. Everything I just mentioned is on this calendar. It isn&#8217;t sustainable.</p>

<p>My 2nd child will be starting her own activities soon, be it swimming or soccer or whatever, and where will THAT go? I&#8217;ve been playing around with Google Calendar and ToDo lists and the like and nothing is as nicely usable and shareable and in your face as a calendar on the fridge.</p>

<p>I began thinking that the fridge needs touchscreen calendar on it. Any typical calendar software would do, I just need to put WAY more information ,that&#8217;s nicely laid out, on my fridge than I have space for.</p>

<p>I figured &#8220;someone has to have an android fridge out by now&#8221; and did some googling. Turns out the only smart fridges out there (that my very short googling found before Terra came out of her bedroom and threw a fit on the floor) have a really small touch screen interface with apps that don&#8217;t update.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well that&#8217;s stupid&#8221;, I thought. I then tweeted that I wanted an android fridge with a mega sized touchscreen that&#8217;s update-able for 30 years. Fridges need to last a long time. You don&#8217;t replace your fridge as often as you update the apps on your smart phone.</p>

<p>A response to my tweet said &#8220;So, you want a fridge with 16GB of RAM, and a multi-core processor?&#8221; and then I thought. 30 years from now 16GB of ram will feel like nothing, just like how 1GB of RAM feels like nothing now, whereas as a few years ago it was blazing fast.</p>

<p>The actual hardware needs to be easily replaceable.</p>

<p>Or.</p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t any hardware for the OS included. What if only the touch screen was provided. What IF you could plug in your device to the screen and it&#8217;s another iOS/android/tizen/whatever device. What if the fridge was just another screen for your device? Don&#8217;t want to deal with plugging and unplugging devices from your fridge all the time? Just buy a cheap android tablet and leave it hooked up. What if it functioned similar to google tv, apple tv? What if you just enhanced your fridge from it&#8217;s base settings with an external device.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re onto something.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t think of anyone I know who would want to spend $3500 every couple years to get a newer, up to date OS in their kitchen for their fridge. Same with the problem with smart tvs right now. We all bought our HD Tvs in the past 10 years and they still work fine. Why would I spend another few thousand dollars for something that barely enhances the fridge I currently have. A fridge only needs to keep my food cold. A great extension to the fridge would be organizing my family&#8217;s life.</p>

	<h1><a href="./setup-sublime-linter-for-php.html">Setup Sublime Linter for PHP</a></h1>
	<div class="post-meta">
		<span class="post-date">August 18, 2012&nbsp;15:20:14</span>
	</div>

	<p>SublimeLinter is a great tool for SublimeText2, however, it took a bit of research.</p>

<p>Installing is easy, go here: <a href="https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter#installing">https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter#installing</a></p>

<p>Setting up for PHP development is the harder part.</p>

<p>After a bunch of research I figured it out</p>

<p>I have both wamp and xampp installed on my machine, but I used xampp for this example as that&#8217;s the php path I found first.</p>

<p>In SublimeLinter -&gt; Settings - User add the following (yes you need to \s)
<code>
{
    "sublimelinter<em>executable</em>map":
    {
        "php": "C:&#92;xampp&#92;php&#92;php.exe"
    }
}
</code></p>

<p>And save. I found I had to reload ST2 to get it to work properly.</p>

<p>After you reload, open up a php file and rename the scope of a function or something, as you type it you will see the entire line (or sometimes the line below) get highlighted. This means it&#8217;s working.</p>

<p>If you didn&#8217;t see any line highlights, open up the the command line (ctrl/cmd+~) and you will see that PHP hadn&#8217;t loaded properly into ST2. Fix up the path to your php.exe in the SublimeLinter User Settings and then you will be good to go.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Sublime Linter no longer highlights syntax every milisecond, it now waits for you to stop typing a bit or save.</p>
