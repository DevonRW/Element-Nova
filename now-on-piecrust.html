	<p>I&#8217;ve moved this blog over onto Github pages as well as am now using <a href="http://bolt80.com/piecrust/">Piecrust</a> to generate the static pages.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t done anything special with piecrust, still just a basic install and have moved posts over. Took longer getting all this setup than I originally expected, however, git was being silly on my machine.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve removed all styles and js from the site for the time being. I&#8217;m thinking about slowly adding small things and seeing where things go. I may go with a mobile first adaptive design, or I may do nothing.</p>
