	<p>I&#8217;ve move this blog over onto Github pages as well as am now using <a href="http://bolt80.com/piecrust/">Piecrust</a> to generate the static pages.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t done anything special with piecrust, still just a basic install and have moved posts over. Took longer getting all this setup than I originally expected, however, git was being silly on my machine.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve removed all styles and js from the site for the time being. I&#8217;m thinking about slowly adding small things and seeing where things go. I may go with a mobile first adaptive design, or I may do nothing.</p>

	<p>We&#8217;ve started a new project at work that involves implementing some interactive charts and will also be using RWD.</p>

<p>Funny thing with Interactive Charts on smaller screens, if you are able to get the chart to take up the entire screen, you cannot swipe off it to continue scrolling.</p>

<p>Heads up.</p>

	<p>I managed a better night&#8217;s sleep compared to the night before, however it was harder to get up for some reason.</p>

<p>I moseyed downstairs at about 1/2 way through breakfast time and noticed the Lean Coffee group was full. I also noticed my buddy, Andrew, was there. Andrew had supper with Ralph and myself last night and asked us tons of questions about Agile and processess and we gave as many tips as we could think of.</p>

<h2>Session 1: Multitaskers Anonymous</h2>

<p>This session started with everyone standing up and doing an exercise to prove a point. This was led by Steve Rogalsky, same Agile dude from yesterday&#8217;s Agile session. I really enjoyed yesterdays session and again, I enjoyed this session.</p>

<p>The general idea behind this session was that interruptions cost money. Lots of money. And if you want to interrupt me because something is important, be aware that it&#8217;d better be MORE important than what I&#8217;m working on.</p>

<p>We had a great Q/A session at the end. I spoke to Steve afterwards and thanked him for the sessions. He mentioned to me to read both &#8220;Getting things done&#8221; and &#8220;Personal Kanban&#8221;. I found it interesting that Steve says &#8220;Kan Ban&#8221; not like everyone else I know says it &#8220;Can Ban&#8221;. He says it &#8220;かんばん&#8221; &#8230; and if that doesn&#8217;t come across in Hiragana it&#8217;s &#8220;khan bahn&#8221;. Anyways, I found that interesting and then realized that it&#8217;s being said that way as it&#8217;s a Japanese term/word/thinger.</p>

<p>So yea, for 8am I sure learned a lot.</p>

<h2>Session 2: Open Data thingermahoosit</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember the actual name of the session. Andy Dyck, Chad McCallum, and Dale Zack presented the overal ideas of Open Data, provided a few examples, and started a conversation. I was able to mention the map I put together using C.o.S&#8217;s Open Data stuffs (<a href="http://devonrw.github.com/2012SaskatoonElectionInteractiveMap/interactive-map.html">linky</a>). I&#8217;m probably done working on it, onto other projects and learning.</p>

<h2>Session 3: Let&#8217;s get Organized</h2>

<p>This was presented by a guy from Point2, Chris Dagenais. He went through some more Agile ideas and while I&#8217;ve noticed no Agile peeps will come out and say it, Agile really seems to play on emotions. For this, if someone tells me to do something AND HOW TO DO IT, I&#8217;ll do it and be pissed off. If someone presents me with a problem and needs my help, I&#8217;m emotionally invested and want to do well. I&#8217;ve noticed that whenever someone comes up to me with the solution and wants me to do it that I get frustrated that I&#8217;m doing it, when they have the solution. However, maybe a good way of working with that is simply pairing with them and letting them drive. They have the idea already and I can work with them to understand their idea fully, and they can be the ones to actually do it.</p>

<p>Building a healthy culture was also discussed. The entire time this was discussed I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking that I had emailed Eden saying that ladies who work at zu are showered in puppies and throw watermelons&#8230;just saying :D</p>

<p>Chris used Voltron as an analogy for a team. I liked that. I&#8217;m using that. Thanks Chris!</p>

<p>We had a decent group discussion after his presentation was over (I didn&#8217;t realize he was done, I was touching notes onto my tablet and then this big discussion started).</p>

<p>One thing that was discussed was removing people who were poor to the culture (toxic was the term used). Those of us with Agile experience said &#8220;fire em&#8221;, which may sound harsh, but what are they actually costing your team/company&#8217;s goals and revenue when you really dig down deep and look at numbers and smart sounding things. I mentioned that, at zu, we pair with developers after they make it past the 1st (or maybe 2nd) round of interviews. Pairing with a developer lets you know how well they work with the team. We had two teams want to hire the same woman because she worked so well with both of us. She was hired, sadly chose the other team, but luckily our teams have merged and now I&#8217;m working with her (boy I&#8217;m rambly&#8230;).</p>

<h2>Lunch: Pasta</h2>

<p>Sat at a table with Ralph, Dave Mosher, Jordan, and&#8230; Dale Zak (I think). We had pasta, it was yummers.</p>

<p>A game of jeopardy was played with 3 people and they all got Best Buy gift cards. None of them knew what Joss Whedon looked like.</p>

<h2>Session 4/5: Sencha Dojo!</h2>

<p>Jordan Boesch gave a quick (45 minutes +) overview of Sencha and then we dug into the code and started building all the things.</p>

<p>The code that was setup for us to download actually had a few bugs in it before it was useable. I&#8217;m not sure if Jordan did this on purpose or not. I learned a lot more by debugging the problems and having to think about what is going on as opposed to just typing what was on the screen, refreshing a page, and saying &#8220;yup, that happens here too&#8221;. I&#8217;ve been to a couple Code Dojos over the past year and the idea of just typing what someone else types and getting the same result feels silly.</p>

<p>It was kinda nice seeing that everyone seemed to run into a little snag while copy typing (that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m calling it now, that&#8217;s what it is :P) and they all were not the same. I ran into a couple problems with my code too, but it turns out that I naturall type PDF as opposed to PCD (I WONDER WHY?!? <em>sarcasm</em>).</p>

<p>Kevin and I had to head back to Saskatoon after our Senchaing was completed. I managed to make it home at about 7:20 and was able to have 2 sleeping girlies by 9pm. Turns out roughly 0% of the housework had been looked after. Nice. All caught up now.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>A special thanks to zu for footing the bill for this trip/conference/mega-learn-a-thon. One thing I&#8217;ve been wanting to do for about a year now is go to a conference outside of Saskatoon. Being able to increase my abilities this way has been awesome.</p>

	</div>

	<p>After 4 hours of tossing and turning it was time for breakfast. Ralph tweeted me to come down for &#8220;Lean Coffee&#8221;. Having no idea what the heck he was talking about I said &#8220;hellz yea&#8221; and wandered down.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a typical conference-in-a-hotel meal. Bacon was good. Turns out that Lean Coffee is kinda neat. You start off with a bunch of ideas, then vote on what to discuss, whatever has the highest acceptance for discussion is what is discussed. I&#8217;m not sure if I actually learned anything at the breakfast (4 hours of sleep) but both Ralph and I came away from that thinking that we could do a Lean Lunch or something at zu to help with developer knowledge transfer.</p>

<p>Keynote speech. Things were kicked off with the creator of Gas Buddy, Jason Toews. He went through Gas Buddy&#8217;s rise and had a couple of good tips. One of those was to build things that people actually want. :p</p>

<p>Onto the conference proper!
<h2>Session 1: Testable Javascript</h2>
James Kovacs gave a brief overview of QUnit, Jasmine, and Mocha. Basically it was just &#8220;look, you can unit test JS, it&#8217;s really not that hard&#8221;. For what I currently do for front-end development I&#8217;m having a hard time trying to figure out how to fit this into our current process but I think after a discussion with a teammate or two that we&#8217;ll have something
<h2>Session 2: So, you want to be a Front-End Engineer?</h2>
Dave Mosher gave an incredible talk looking at how web browsers actually work. The overall idea was &#8220;how did we arrive at our best practices&#8221;. He went through what a browser does and the internal workings of it. After that he went through a few best practices and WHY we have them
<ol>
    <li>script tag right before your closing body tag</li>
    <li>nice selectors and how they work for CSS [no really&#8230;HOW they work, we spent what felt like quite a bit of time on it but it was sooooooooooo worth it]</li>
    <li>when using JS to modify things visually, assign class(es), not styles.</li>
</ol>
I really enjoyed this presentation. I&#8217;ve never seen Dave present before but this flowed quite nicely. Good jorb!
<h2>Lunch at 5 Guys or Everyone deciding not to go to 5 Guys</h2>
Yea, we all changed our minds at the last minute.</p>

<p>However, we had a nice table of 3 zu-peeps and 3 former zu-peeps for lunch so that was fun.
<h2>Session 4: Silence of Agile</h2>
This was led by Steve Rogalsky, who led the Lean Coffee thing at 7am, and was incredible. There only ended up being 6 or 7 people there, but I think that made it a lot better. The overall idea of the presentation was that talking can influence other&#8217;s decisions (or that&#8217;s what I got out of it). He promoted the idea of doing things in silence (estimating, organizing, and other things that I don&#8217;t remember right now).</p>

<p>He also had a few other ideas on the board that I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to bring to the team. I don&#8217;t think that Planning Poker would work well with us, but I do like the idea of Silent Planning Poker Party for big project estimations. I think Ralph was disagreeing with me on that one, but I don&#8217;t remember now (4 hours of sleep).</p>

<p>Steve also mentioned that at his company they do strategy planning with everyone in the company, and everyone has equal votes and equal ideas. So someone who is hired a week earlier has the same power as the CEO does. The CEO also goes towards the end of the planning so his decision does not affect what others do.</p>

<p>His presentation was very well done. Again, only having 6 or 7 people there made it more intimate. I think everyone else was at the HTML5 presentation learning that HTML5 exists or something.</p>

<p>At this point in time I started thinking &#8220;I could have probably done a presentation on Responsive Web Design&#8221; and then started putting together some notes. I&#8217;ll probably do a presentation at work on one and then see if BarCamp can fit into my homelife schedule (3rd kid coming soon).
<h2>Session 4: Continuous Integration Evolved</h2>
I barely remember what we talked about. Overall it was &#8220;CI is good, but are you actually doing true CI or do you just think you are?&#8221; Which did get me thinking a bit about how we currently do our releases on one of our ongoing projects.
<h2>Session 5: Do, This; No Do That: Building the Bridge Between Creative &amp; Code</h2>
This was presented by Eden Rhotensky and was enjoyable. Overall the idea was to improve relations between designers and developers. Now, I&#8217;m very lucky to work with a designer on our team, and I know that we bring out the best in each other, so I didn&#8217;t gain any grand schemes.</p>

<p>I do like the way she thinks about how to get things done and work as a team.
<h2>Supper all the things</h2>
Ralph, Andrew and I had supper together. Ralph and I have never really just sat and chatted about &#8220;stuffs&#8221; over a meal and a drink.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m up in my hotel room watching Raw and typing this.</p>

<p>Yup, good day. Super glad I came down here. Snaps to zu for footing the bill.</p>

	</div>

	<p>I was trying to get a short video to help out Brian Hogan for a class he&#8217;s doing. The goal: &#8220;I want to get them fired up about our industry&#8221;.</p>

<p>I was super pumped at the idea and I spent a few minutes last night jotting down notes about what I wanted to say.</p>

<p>And then for some reason I couldn&#8217;t figure out the microphone on the laptop I&#8217;m currently using. Pain in the rear.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&#8217;s roughly what I wanted to say.
<blockquote>Introduce Self: Devon, web developer from zu</p>

<p>Why you love what you do:
Constant learning, new tools created by the community for the community, create and play with new techonolgies, solving new problems both big and small every day, support from others in the community, and being able to create something that is used and loved by countless people.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m lucky enough to be in an industry that has driven change in the world, be it from organizations using Google Maps to fight enormous amounts of deforestation, governments being able to share information quickly and easily with their citizens on github, or connecting with Star Trek cast member by him sending me a funny picture a teen vampire franchise</p>

<p>Web development, love it, I strongly recommend you start</blockquote></p>

<p>For fun you can see when I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mlovaswb7g" target="_blank">first attempted to record onto youtube.</a> (keep in mind, no audio&#8230;.)</p>
