	<p>After 4 hours of tossing and turning it was time for breakfast. Ralph tweeted me to come down for &#8220;Lean Coffee&#8221;. Having no idea what the heck he was talking about I said &#8220;hellz yea&#8221; and wandered down.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a typical conference-in-a-hotel meal. Bacon was good. Turns out that Lean Coffee is kinda neat. You start off with a bunch of ideas, then vote on what to discuss, whatever has the highest acceptance for discussion is what is discussed. I&#8217;m not sure if I actually learned anything at the breakfast (4 hours of sleep) but both Ralph and I came away from that thinking that we could do a Lean Lunch or something at zu to help with developer knowledge transfer.</p>

<p>Keynote speech. Things were kicked off with the creator of Gas Buddy, Jason Toews. He went through Gas Buddy&#8217;s rise and had a couple of good tips. One of those was to build things that people actually want. :p</p>

<p>Onto the conference proper!
<h2>Session 1: Testable Javascript</h2>
James Kovacs gave a brief overview of QUnit, Jasmine, and Mocha. Basically it was just &#8220;look, you can unit test JS, it&#8217;s really not that hard&#8221;. For what I currently do for front-end development I&#8217;m having a hard time trying to figure out how to fit this into our current process but I think after a discussion with a teammate or two that we&#8217;ll have something
<h2>Session 2: So, you want to be a Front-End Engineer?</h2>
Dave Mosher gave an incredible talk looking at how web browsers actually work. The overall idea was &#8220;how did we arrive at our best practices&#8221;. He went through what a browser does and the internal workings of it. After that he went through a few best practices and WHY we have them
<ol>
    <li>script tag right before your closing body tag</li>
    <li>nice selectors and how they work for CSS [no really&#8230;HOW they work, we spent what felt like quite a bit of time on it but it was sooooooooooo worth it]</li>
    <li>when using JS to modify things visually, assign class(es), not styles.</li>
</ol>
I really enjoyed this presentation. I&#8217;ve never seen Dave present before but this flowed quite nicely. Good jorb!
<h2>Lunch at 5 Guys or Everyone deciding not to go to 5 Guys</h2>
Yea, we all changed our minds at the last minute.</p>

<p>However, we had a nice table of 3 zu-peeps and 3 former zu-peeps for lunch so that was fun.
<h2>Session 4: Silence of Agile</h2>
This was led by Steve Rogalsky, who led the Lean Coffee thing at 7am, and was incredible. There only ended up being 6 or 7 people there, but I think that made it a lot better. The overall idea of the presentation was that talking can influence other&#8217;s decisions (or that&#8217;s what I got out of it). He promoted the idea of doing things in silence (estimating, organizing, and other things that I don&#8217;t remember right now).</p>

<p>He also had a few other ideas on the board that I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to bring to the team. I don&#8217;t think that Planning Poker would work well with us, but I do like the idea of Silent Planning Poker Party for big project estimations. I think Ralph was disagreeing with me on that one, but I don&#8217;t remember now (4 hours of sleep).</p>

<p>Steve also mentioned that at his company they do strategy planning with everyone in the company, and everyone has equal votes and equal ideas. So someone who is hired a week earlier has the same power as the CEO does. The CEO also goes towards the end of the planning so his decision does not affect what others do.</p>

<p>His presentation was very well done. Again, only having 6 or 7 people there made it more intimate. I think everyone else was at the HTML5 presentation learning that HTML5 exists or something.</p>

<p>At this point in time I started thinking &#8220;I could have probably done a presentation on Responsive Web Design&#8221; and then started putting together some notes. I&#8217;ll probably do a presentation at work on one and then see if BarCamp can fit into my homelife schedule (3rd kid coming soon).
<h2>Session 4: Continuous Integration Evolved</h2>
I barely remember what we talked about. Overall it was &#8220;CI is good, but are you actually doing true CI or do you just think you are?&#8221; Which did get me thinking a bit about how we currently do our releases on one of our ongoing projects.
<h2>Session 5: Do, This; No Do That: Building the Bridge Between Creative &amp; Code</h2>
This was presented by Eden Rhotensky and was enjoyable. Overall the idea was to improve relations between designers and developers. Now, I&#8217;m very lucky to work with a designer on our team, and I know that we bring out the best in each other, so I didn&#8217;t gain any grand schemes.</p>

<p>I do like the way she thinks about how to get things done and work as a team.
<h2>Supper all the things</h2>
Ralph, Andrew and I had supper together. Ralph and I have never really just sat and chatted about &#8220;stuffs&#8221; over a meal and a drink.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m up in my hotel room watching Raw and typing this.</p>

<p>Yup, good day. Super glad I came down here. Snaps to zu for footing the bill.</p>
