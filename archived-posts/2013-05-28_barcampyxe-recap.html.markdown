I finally made it to a BarCamp. In fact, I actually spoke at it. More on that in a bit.

## What I learned from the talks

1. Coding live with people looks kinda stressful if something silly isn't working
2. Everyone's on your side

## What I learned from my talk

1. Have your presentation on your machine, since having internet access isn't gonna happen
2. Practicing a few times before hand sure helps when your notes aren't working for some dumb reason

All in all this was a good experience. I wasn't too happy with my presentation but I was happy that I did it.

The talk I gave was mostly high level ideas about how we should build our websites for everyone by targeting HTML4 and then HTML5 browsers, as well as performance improving ideas. I'll be discussing these ideas in more details with the majority of the zu devs in the morning.

Good catching up with [@dmosher](http://www.twitter.com/dmosher), [@fexd](http://www.twitter.com/fexd), [@thebatlab](http://www.twitter.com/thebatlab) and finally meeting [@interlock](http://www.twitter.com/interlock), [@gingerk](http://www.twitter.com/gingerk) in person.
