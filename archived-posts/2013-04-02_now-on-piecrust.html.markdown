I've moved this blog over onto Github pages as well as am now using [Piecrust](http://bolt80.com/piecrust/) to generate the static pages.

I haven't done anything special with piecrust, still just a basic install and have moved posts over. Took longer getting all this setup than I originally expected, however, git was being silly on my machine.

I've removed all styles and js from the site for the time being. I'm thinking about slowly adding small things and seeing where things go. I may go with a mobile first adaptive design, or I may do nothing.
