      <p>After 4 hours of tossing and turning it was time for breakfast. Ralph tweeted me to come down for "Lean Coffee". Having no idea what the heck he was talking about I said "hellz yea" and wandered down.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a typical conference-in-a-hotel meal. Bacon was good. Turns out that Lean Coffee is kinda neat. You start off with a bunch of ideas, then vote on what to discuss, whatever has the highest acceptance for discussion is what is discussed. I'm not sure if I actually learned anything at the breakfast (4 hours of sleep) but both Ralph and I came away from that thinking that we could do a Lean Lunch or something at zu to help with developer knowledge transfer.</p>

<p>Keynote speech. Things were kicked off with the creator of Gas Buddy, Jason Toews. He went through Gas Buddy's rise and had a couple of good tips. One of those was to build things that people actually want. :p</p>

<p>Onto the conference proper!</p>
<h2>Session 1: Testable Javascript</h2>
<p>James Kovacs gave a brief overview of QUnit, Jasmine, and Mocha. Basically it was just "look, you can unit test JS, it's really not that hard". For what I currently do for front-end development I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how to fit this into our current process but I think after a discussion with a teammate or two that we'll have something</p>
<h2>Session 2: So, you want to be a Front-End Engineer?</h2>
<p>Dave Mosher gave an incredible talk looking at how web browsers actually work. The overall idea was "how did we arrive at our best practices". He went through what a browser does and the internal workings of it. After that he went through a few best practices and WHY we have them</p>
<ol>
	<li>script tag right before your closing body tag</li>
	<li>nice selectors and how they work for CSS [no really...HOW they work, we spent what felt like quite a bit of time on it but it was sooooooooooo worth it]</li>
	<li>when using JS to modify things visually, assign class(es), not styles.</li>
</ol>
<p>I really enjoyed this presentation. I've never seen Dave present before but this flowed quite nicely. Good jorb!</p>
<h2>Lunch at 5 Guys or Everyone deciding not to go to 5 Guys</h2>
<p>Yea, we all changed our minds at the last minute.</p>

<p>However, we had a nice table of 3 zu-peeps and 3 former zu-peeps for lunch so that was fun.</p>
<h2>Session 4: Silence of Agile</h2>
<p>This was led by Steve Rogalsky, who led the Lean Coffee thing at 7am, and was incredible. There only ended up being 6 or 7 people there, but I think that made it a lot better. The overall idea of the presentation was that talking can influence other's decisions (or that's what I got out of it). He promoted the idea of doing things in silence (estimating, organizing, and other things that I don't remember right now).</p>

<p>He also had a few other ideas on the board that I'm trying to figure out how to bring to the team. I don't think that Planning Poker would work well with us, but I do like the idea of Silent Planning Poker Party for big project estimations. I think Ralph was disagreeing with me on that one, but I don't remember now (4 hours of sleep).</p>

<p>Steve also mentioned that at his company they do strategy planning with everyone in the company, and everyone has equal votes and equal ideas. So someone who is hired a week earlier has the same power as the CEO does. The CEO also goes towards the end of the planning so his decision does not affect what others do.</p>

<p>His presentation was very well done. Again, only having 6 or 7 people there made it more intimate. I think everyone else was at the HTML5 presentation learning that HTML5 exists or something.</p>

<p>At this point in time I started thinking "I could have probably done a presentation on Responsive Web Design" and then started putting together some notes. I'll probably do a presentation at work on one and then see if BarCamp can fit into my homelife schedule (3rd kid coming soon).</p>
<h2>Session 4: Continuous Integration Evolved</h2>
<p>I barely remember what we talked about. Overall it was "CI is good, but are you actually doing true CI or do you just think you are?" Which did get me thinking a bit about how we currently do our releases on one of our ongoing projects.</p>
<h2>Session 5: Do, This; No Do That: Building the Bridge Between Creative &amp; Code</h2>
<p>This was presented by Eden Rhotensky and was enjoyable. Overall the idea was to improve relations between designers and developers. Now, I'm very lucky to work with a designer on our team, and I know that we bring out the best in each other, so I didn't gain any grand schemes.</p>

<p>I do like the way she thinks about how to get things done and work as a team.</p>
<h2>Supper all the things</h2>
<p>Ralph, Andrew and I had supper together. Ralph and I have never really just sat and chatted about "stuffs" over a meal and a drink.</p>

<p>Now I'm up in my hotel room watching Raw and typing this.</p>

<p>Yup, good day. Super glad I came down here. Snaps to zu for footing the bill.</p>
