I was standing at my fridge last night looking at the gigantic calendar that we have on it and I thought "we need more information available here". My eldest daughter does 7 things throughout the week. Every single one of those events is on the calendar. We get garbage pickup every week (soon to be every other week). We get recycle picked up every other week. We manage our finances every two weeks (we're on a jar system). My wife does contract work outside of the house so that's tracked. Our meal plan is on the calendar as well. Everything I just mentioned is on this calendar. It isn't sustainable.

My 2nd child will be starting her own activities soon, be it swimming or soccer or whatever, and where will THAT go? I've been playing around with Google Calendar and ToDo lists and the like and nothing is as nicely usable and shareable and in your face as a calendar on the fridge.

I began thinking that the fridge needs touchscreen calendar on it. Any typical calendar software would do, I just need to put WAY more information ,that's nicely laid out, on my fridge than I have space for.

I figured "someone has to have an android fridge out by now" and did some googling. Turns out the only smart fridges out there (that my very short googling found before Terra came out of her bedroom and threw a fit on the floor) have a really small touch screen interface with apps that don't update.

"Well that's stupid", I thought. I then tweeted that I wanted an android fridge with a mega sized touchscreen that's update-able for 30 years. Fridges need to last a long time. You don't replace your fridge as often as you update the apps on your smart phone.

A response to my tweet said "So, you want a fridge with 16GB of RAM, and a multi-core processor?" and then I thought. 30 years from now 16GB of ram will feel like nothing, just like how 1GB of RAM feels like nothing now, whereas as a few years ago it was blazing fast.

The actual hardware needs to be easily replaceable.

Or.

There isn't any hardware for the OS included. What if only the touch screen was provided. What IF you could plug in your device to the screen and it's another iOS/android/tizen/whatever device. What if the fridge was just another screen for your device? Don't want to deal with plugging and unplugging devices from your fridge all the time? Just buy a cheap android tablet and leave it hooked up. What if it functioned similar to google tv, apple tv? What if you just enhanced your fridge from it's base settings with an external device.

Now we're onto something.

I can't think of anyone I know who would want to spend $3500 every couple years to get a newer, up to date OS in their kitchen for their fridge. Same with the problem with smart tvs right now. We all bought our HD Tvs in the past 10 years and they still work fine. Why would I spend another few thousand dollars for something that barely enhances the fridge I currently have. A fridge only needs to keep my food cold. A great extension to the fridge would be organizing my family's life.
