I was trying to get a short video to help out Brian Hogan for a class he's doing. The goal: "I want to get them fired up about our industry".

I was super pumped at the idea and I spent a few minutes last night jotting down notes about what I wanted to say.

And then for some reason I couldn't figure out the microphone on the laptop I'm currently using. Pain in the rear.

Anyways, here's roughly what I wanted to say.
<blockquote>Introduce Self: Devon, web developer from zu

Why you love what you do:
Constant learning, new tools created by the community for the community, create and play with new techonolgies, solving new problems both big and small every day, support from others in the community, and being able to create something that is used and loved by countless people.

I'm lucky enough to be in an industry that has driven change in the world, be it from organizations using Google Maps to fight enormous amounts of deforestation, governments being able to share information quickly and easily with their citizens on github, or connecting with Star Trek cast member by him sending me a funny picture a teen vampire franchise

Web development, love it, I strongly recommend you start</blockquote>
